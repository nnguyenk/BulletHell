# BULLET HELL GAME

## Overview
🌟 A simple bullet-hell implmented using Java, created in collaboration with two undergrad classmates<br>
🌟 This game is my final project in the OOP course of Macalester College

## About the game
✡️ Player controls an avatar and navigates around a dungeon of randomly-spawned, ricocheting bullets<br>
✡️ Bullets disappear after a few collisions with walls, or upon damaging the player, which removes one life<br>
✡️ Number of bullets increase per round. The game goes on infinitely until player runs out of all three lives<br>
✡️ Player posesses three abilities that go on their respective cooldown upon activation. Ex: pressing Q slows all remaining bullets

## My contributions
✔️ Designed and implemented effects of three abilities and three bullet types<br>
✔️ Worked on closures for bullet movements and ability cooldowns<br>
✔️ Wrote methods for spawning bullets

## Room for improvements
❌ Janky sprite animations<br>
❌ Lags at higher levels from various moving components (i.e. incrementing no. of bullets)<br>
❌ Inaccurate hitboxes
